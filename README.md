The goal of this project is to build a 64-bit POSIX-compliant tick-less kernel
with a Linux-compatible syscall implementation using [Go](https://golang.org). 

This project is not about building yet another OS but rather exists to serve as
proof that Go is indeed a suitable tool for writing low-level code that runs
at ring-0.

**Note**: This project is still in the early stages of development and is not yet
in a usable state. In fact, if you build the ISO and boot it, the kernel will 
eventually panic with a `Kmain returned` error.

To find out more about the current project status and feature roadmap take a
look at the [status](STATUS.md) page.

## Building and running gopher-os 

TL;DR version: `make run-qemu` or `make run-vbox`. 

A detailed guide about building, running and debugging gopher-os on
Linux/OSX as well as the list of supported boot command line options are
available [here](BUILD.md).
